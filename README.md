EXPLANATION :
 open Power BI Desktop and go to “Home” → “Get Data”, then select CSV or the appropriate data source. Browse and upload the dataset, then click “Load” to bring the data into Power BI.
Next, click “Transform Data” to open Power Query Editor for cleaning and preparing the dataset. Handle missing values by replacing or removing nulls, change data types (e.g., converting numerical and date fields), and rename columns for clarity. Remove duplicates if necessary and click “Close & Apply” to save changes.
In the Report View, select a visualization type such as bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and drag fields onto the visualization canvas. For example, dragging “City” to the X-axis and “Tourist Visits” to the Y-axis creates a meaningful comparison. Customize colors, labels, and styles for better readability. To refine analysis, add filters and slicers to allow users to dynamically adjust the data display. For example, using a slicer for “Country” enables filtering by location.
For deeper insights, create DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations. For instance, a new column can classify sentiment based on ratings using Sentiment = IF([Rating] > 3, "Positive", "Negative"). Identifying trends, patterns, and outliers in the data can provide valuable business intelligence.
Once the report is ready, click “Publish” to upload it to Power BI Service, allowing for easy sharing with team members or embedding in websites. The final output is an interactive dashboard that provides dynamic insights, enabling users to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions
